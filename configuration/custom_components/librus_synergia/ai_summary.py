"""Weekly AI summary of the school week, through Home Assistant's AI Task.

Same model as ha-suunto's daily AI insight: no API key lives in this
integration. The user sets up any AI provider (Google Gemini, OpenAI,
Anthropic, a local Ollama...) as a normal Home Assistant integration and
picks its ``ai_task`` entity in our options; we only call the
``ai_task.generate_data`` action with a compact JSON snapshot of data the
coordinator already has. Nothing extra is fetched from Librus for this.

What it covers: the 7 days ending on the run day (grades, how the averages
moved, attendance, behaviour notes, optionally messages/announcements) and
the 7 days after it (agenda, homework due, timetable changes, free days).

When it runs:
- on the chosen weekday at the chosen time;
- on a coordinator update within 2 days after that moment, if the scheduled
  run was missed (HA down) or failed (provider down, quota) - at most
  ``MAX_ATTEMPTS`` tries per scheduled run;
- on demand, from the "Generate weekly summary" button.
A scheduled run is skipped (and counted as done) when the whole window is
empty - summer holidays should not cost a model call every week. The result
is kept in a Store, so a restart never pays for the same summary twice.

_INSTRUCTIONS = """You summarise one student's school week from the Polish e-gradebook
Librus Synergia. Below is a JSON snapshot as of {today}.
{audience}

Rules:
- Write every field in {language}.
- Base every statement on the data given. Never invent grades, tests or events;
  ignore what is missing. An empty list means nothing happened, which is worth
  saying briefly (e.g. no absences this week).
- Be specific: name subjects, values, dates.
- Keep each section to its own topic; do not repeat a point in two sections.
- If school_days_this_week and school_days_next_week are 0 (holidays), keep every
  section to one or two sentences.
- Use plain hyphens; never long dashes. Write dates as day.month (e.g. 14.10).
- Every date in the data carries its weekday (e.g. "2026-10-06 Tue"). When you name
  a weekday, use exactly that one; never work a weekday out yourself.
- Write numbers the way {language} does (decimal comma where that is the norm).
- No diagnoses, no judging the student's character, no comparisons with other
  students. A single weak grade is not a trend.
- warning: only for something that genuinely needs attention (several unexcused
  absences, a clear drop in a subject, a test tomorrow with recent weak grades in
  it); otherwise leave it empty.

Field notes: Polish grades go 1 (worst) to 6 (best); "+" adds 0.5 and "-" takes
0.25 off (4- = 3.75). Non-numeric marks like "np" (unprepared), "bz" (missing
work), a bare "+" or "-" (activity plus/minus), "nb" (absent) do not count toward
the average. weight is the category weight in the weighted average;
counts_to_average false means it does not count. averages[].week_ago is the
average without this week's grades (null = the subject had no grades before).
average_mode says which average the family uses. attendance.this_week counts
lesson records; open_unexcused is the whole school year. Streaks: good_grade_streak
= grades 4 or better in a row, days_without_absence / days_without_negative_note
are calendar days. attendance.absences lists this week's absences and lates. next_week.agenda holds tests, trips and other entries from the
class calendar; homework_due is real homework with its due date.
