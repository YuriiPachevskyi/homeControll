# (see `coordinator.py::optional_endpoint_issue_id`). Keep in sync with

# Labels for TIER 1's own degradable endpoints - `Me` is deliberately NOT
# here (kept as a separate, always-fatal fetch ahead of this tier - if we
# can't even identify who the account belongs to, something is genuinely
# wrong, not just "a module this account type doesn't have"). In the
# exact order passed to `_async_fetch_core_payloads`' first
# `asyncio.gather()` call (Me excluded). Public for the same reason as
# OPTIONAL_ENDPOINT_LABELS - `__init__.py` also needs it, and it shares
# that same repair-issue tracking/translation key (see
# `coordinator.py::_degrade_core_payload`).
#
# BUG FIX (issue #5, reported live): a preschool-account login only has
# the Wiadomości module enabled - `Attendances/Types` 403'd (a module this
# account type genuinely doesn't have, confirmed by the reporter checking
# the real Synergia web UI independently) and took down the ENTIRE setup,
# even though Grades/Attendances/etc. simply don't apply to that account
# and Wiadomości (what the reporter actually needed) would have worked
# fine. Previously only `Timetables` had this "confirmed 403 = module
# unavailable, degrade gracefully" treatment (issue #4); generalized here
# to the whole core tier since the SAME class of report would otherwise
# just recur with a different endpoint name for the next limited-access
# account type.
#
# NOTE: the two "Timetable (this week/next week)" entries below
# structurally can never show up as degraded - `_fetch_timetable_or_
# unpublished` already catches its own confirmed 403 and returns `{}`
# BEFORE `_degrade_core_payload` ever sees an exception for those two
# gather positions, so they'll only ever be observed as a (harmless,
# no-op) "recovery". The REAL Timetable tracking happens under the
# plain "Timetable" label (singular, no week suffix) inside
# `_fetch_timetable_or_unpublished` itself - see
# MISC_DEGRADABLE_ENDPOINT_LABELS below. Kept here anyway (rather than
# reworking the gather's positional zip) since a stray "recovered" call
# for a label that was never marked failing is a complete no-op.

# category lookups. Public (moved here from coordinator.py, code review)
# for the same __init__.py-cleanup reason as the other *_LABELS tuples -
# this tier's degrades are now tracked the same way as core/supplementary
# (see coordinator.py::_degrade_reference_result) after a real gap: an
# account with several reference-data endpoints failing (e.g. Classes,
# while Schools worked) was invisible in diagnostics before this, which
# is exactly the account this whole degrade-tracking feature was built to

# tracking. "Timetable" is the ACTUAL tracked label for timetable
# degrades (see CORE_ENDPOINT_LABELS' own note above for why the two
# per-week labels there are dead weight). "Messages" covers the bootstrap
# + inbox/unread-count fetch; "Messages/Secondary" covers the
