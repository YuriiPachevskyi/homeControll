"""Data update coordinator for the Librus Synergia (unofficial) integration.

Single coordinator, not split by cadence: unlike ha-suunto (live heart rate
vs. sleep/workouts genuinely differ in volatility), Librus data - grades,
attendance, timetable, announcements - all change at "a few times a day at
most" cadence, so one coordinator covers everything. The one exception (the
daily lucky number) is special-cased inline rather than given its own
coordinator, for the same reason ha-suunto special-cases its one-off VO2max
deep-scan inside its normal coordinator instead of adding new machinery for a
single edge case.

        Split into two tiers, on purpose - previously all 16 endpoints were
        in ONE asyncio.gather(), so a single failure on any of them (e.g. a
        newer, less-exercised endpoint like DescriptiveGrades hiccuping)
        raised and discarded every OTHER endpoint's already-successful
        result too, wiping grades/attendance/timetable for the whole cycle
        over one unrelated endpoint. TIER 1 below is the original,
        genuinely load-bearing sensors; TIER 2 is the newer supplementary
        endpoints. Both now use `return_exceptions=True` and degrade a
        CONFIRMED 403 to empty (see `_degrade_core_payload`/
        `_degrade_optional_payload`) - a genuine 401 anywhere still
        propagates and still drives the forced-relogin-and-retry-once

        `Me` is deliberately fetched separately, BEFORE either tier, and

        CORE_ENDPOINT_LABELS' own comment for why.

        `asyncio.gather()` with no `return_exceptions=True` at all - a
        CONFIRMED 403 on `Attendances/Types` (a preschool-account login
        that only has the Wiadomości module enabled) took down the whole
        setup, even though it just meant "this account doesn't have the
        attendance module", the exact same class of thing `Timetables`
        already got this treatment for once (issue #4). Generalized to
        the whole tier now, not just Timetables, since the next limited-
        access account type would otherwise just report the same bug
        again with a different endpoint name.

        returns False, checked via the "Brak dostępu" marker), not an error.
        Any other failure here is also non-fatal - messages are a bonus
        feature, not core data, and must never fail the whole update cycle.

        BUG FIX (live feedback, 2026-09-23 - "też tak kurwa mam", reproduced
        on the maintainer's own account too): `_messages_bootstrapped` used
        to only ever get set `True`, never back to `False` - so once EITHER
        the bootstrap call OR the primary fetch below raised a real
        `LibrusError`, messages stayed silently empty FOREVER, confirmed
        live via a real account's own `last_reported` advancing on schedule
        while `last_updated` stayed frozen on the stale empty result. Only
        a full HA restart/reload cleared it. Fixed by resetting the flag on
        failure so the NEXT cycle gets a fresh bootstrap attempt.

        BUG FIX #2 (same day, same live account, confirmed by direct
        repeated observation): fixing #1 alone still left a real, visible
        gap - the dedicated wiadomosci.librus.pl session turned out to die
        far more often than expected (repeatedly, well within an hour, on
        a real account - unlike the main Synergia session's own ~20h
        lifetime), so "retry next cycle" meant the sensor could sit empty
        for however long the poll interval is. The main session has had an
        IMMEDIATE same-cycle retry for this exact class of problem since
        v0.4.2 (forced relogin + retry once, before ever surfacing a gap to
        the user) - messages never got the equivalent. `_async_bootstrap_
        and_fetch_primary` below is now called up to twice in a row: once
        normally, once more immediately if that raised, mirroring the main
        session's own proven pattern instead of waiting out a whole poll
        cycle.
