"""What to revise for an upcoming test.

A test's material is, in practice, what was taught in that subject since
the previous test in the same subject. Librus has both halves: the Agenda
(`HomeWorks`) says when a test is and in which subject, and `Realizations`
lists every lesson held with its topic. This module joins them; the Next
exam sensor, the Assist tools and the weekly AI summary all use it.

Pure functions over `LibrusData` - no Home Assistant imports.
