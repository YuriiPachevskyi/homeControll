"""Low-level constants for talking to Librus's Synergia/API gateway.

Librus changed its authentication mechanism around 2026-03-28 (confirmed via
the `emsi/librus_pyapi` project's changelog and by our own live testing on
2026-09-05): the older `api.librus.pl/OAuth/Token` password-grant flow that
szkolny-eu/szkolny-android (GPL-3.0) documented now returns
`unsupported_grant_type`. The flow implemented here - a login form POST to
the `/OAuth/Authorization` endpoint followed by a manually-walked redirect
chain - is reverse-engineered from `emsi/librus_pyapi` (MIT-licensed, updated
for this exact change) and confirmed live to complete WITHOUT a captcha
challenge for a normal login.

Unlike the old flow, this one is cookie/session-based, not bearer-token
based: there is no OAuth `access_token`/`refresh_token` pair, only a
same-day `oauth_token` session cookie (confirmed live to expire ~24h after
login) plus a long-lived (~1 year) `DeviceCookie` on api.librus.pl that is
almost certainly why a normal login skips captcha/2FA - it marks the client
as a previously-seen device. Persisting and re-sending that cookie jar
across logins (and across Home Assistant restarts) is important for staying
captcha-free long-term, not just a nice-to-have.
