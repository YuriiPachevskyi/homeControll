"""Exception hierarchy for the Librus API client.

Shaped so a caller's `except LibrusAuthError` cannot accidentally catch
`LibrusUnexpectedResponseError` for a case that isn't really about
credentials - the former means "ask the user to log in again", the latter
means "something about the response shape surprised us".

Note on failure-mode coverage: the happy path (successful login through the
2026-03-28-era Authorization-endpoint flow) is confirmed live. A genuinely
WRONG password was deliberately never tested against a real account (to
avoid tripping any credential-attempt-counting abuse heuristic on someone's
real Librus account), so `LibrusInvalidCredentialsError`'s trigger condition
in `client.py` (a login response with no `goTo` field) is a reasonable
inference, not a confirmed observation - flagged for whoever next hits a
real bad-password case to verify.

    CONFIRMED live (2026-09-05): Librus's real session lifetime can run
    shorter than our own conservative `ASSUMED_SESSION_LIFETIME_SECONDS`
    estimate (20h) - a `Timetables` fetch got a 401 while our own
    elapsed-time clock still considered the session fresh. Deliberately a
    SEPARATE class from `LibrusInvalidCredentialsError`: the stored
    password is very likely still correct here, so the coordinator forces
    one fresh login + retry (see coordinator.py::_async_update_data)
    before ever surfacing Home Assistant's reauth flow to the user. Only
    escalate to reauth if that forced re-login itself fails.

    `status_code` (CONFIRMED reported live, issue #4) - a 403 on
    `Timetables` specifically can mean the school simply hasn't published
    the class's timetable yet ("Plan lekcji klasy ... nie został jeszcze
    opublikowany" in Synergia's own web UI), a real and permanent-until-the-
    school-acts condition that a fresh re-login can never fix. Kept
    separate from a genuine 401 (session actually dead) so the coordinator
    can tell the two apart instead of forcing a pointless relogin-and-retry
    that only ends in an incorrect reauth prompt."""
