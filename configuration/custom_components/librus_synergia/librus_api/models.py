"""Typed shapes for parsed Librus API data.

Field names come from szkolny-eu/szkolny-android's source reading the same
`api.librus.pl/2.0` endpoints this client calls. Parsing is defensive
(missing keys default sensibly) because Librus doesn't publish a schema and
per-school variations are known to exist upstream (see RustySnek/librus-apix's
README: "some schools have different librus setups which may cause
errors/warnings").
