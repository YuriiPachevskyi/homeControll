"""School-day logic shared by the binary sensors and the start/end sensors.

Everything here reads the coordinator's cached current+next-week timetable
(no extra Librus requests). A day counts as a school day when it has at
least one lesson that isn't cancelled and isn't inside a free day from
`SchoolFreeDays`/`ClassFreeDays` (some schools leave the timetable filled
in on a day off).
